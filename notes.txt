When creating namespaces, use imperative command instead of declarative

kubectl create ns demo
kubectl scale --replicas=3 deploy/demo -n namespace

to get the endpoint of the pod
cat /etc/resolv.conf


Taints and Toleration
	- in pods you need to specify the taints you put into nodes so that it can deploy on the nodes it needs to be put. For example with AI workloads we need a gpu so we put a taints on the node (the bigger one) like gpu = true
	- and when we create a pod we need to specify that the pod will tolerate the gpu=true so that it will be deploy on the node that has GPU.
	- Syntax
		○ kubectl taint node <name> key:value:effect [NoSchedule, NoExecute, PreferNoSchedule]
		○ to untaint just add "-" on the end

Labeling the node
	- kubectl label node <name> key=value
	- for removing the label you just omit the value and add trailing hyphen(-)

To show the labels
	- kubectl node <name> --show-labels

For more strict and accurate deployment of pods it's recommended to use both taint & tolerations and node affinity


openssl genrsa -o vanj.key 2048
openssl req -new -key vanj.key -out vanj.csr -subj "//CN=vanj"
cat ./vanj.csr | base64 | tr -d "\n"
kubectl get csr vanj-csr -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}' | base64 -d > vanj.crt
